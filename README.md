# connor-neale-weather-dashboard

## Weather Board Goal
This is a weather dashboard that uses server side apis. Using server side apis I was able to let the user search for cities present and future forecast. It will save the cities weather data in local storage and present the data when the user goes to the webpage. They can also clear the webpage.
